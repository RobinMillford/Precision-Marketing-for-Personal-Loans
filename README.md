In this project, we conducted an in-depth analysis of a dataset containing personal loan information. The dataset includes various attributes such as age, income, family size, education level, and details about financial products such as personal loans, credit cards, and certificates of deposit (CD accounts).

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
1. **Duplicates and Null Values:** We identified and handled duplicate rows, and also counted and addressed null values in the dataset.
2. **Column Removal:** Unnecessary columns such as 'ID' and 'ZIP Code' were removed to focus on relevant features.

**Data Exploration and Enrichment:**
3. **Filtering and Categorization:** Rows were filtered based on specific conditions, and new categorical columns ('EDU' and 'Account_holder_category') were introduced using custom functions.
4. **Statistical Analysis:** SQL queries were employed to calculate aggregate statistics such as average income and counts based on various conditions.

**Visualizations:**
To complement the analysis, visualizations were created using Tableau. Some of the key visualizations include:
- **Age Distribution:** Histogram depicting the distribution of ages in the dataset.
- **Income by Education Level:** Bar chart illustrating the average income for different education levels.
- **Top 10 Incomes:** Bar chart showcasing the top 10 records based on income.
- **Account Holder Categories:** Pie chart representing the distribution of account holder categories.

**Insights and Findings:**
- Customers with higher education levels tend to have higher average incomes.
- The dataset contains a diverse range of account holder categories.
- The majority of customers in the dataset have not taken a personal loan.
